# Genetic-Sequence-Compression

A compression application for genetic sequences based on the Sequitur and DNASequitur algorithms. Extended to include the use of approximate repeats to form edit grammars as well as the inclusion of some initial search functionality. Compression and decompression are fundamentally complete, however, the project as a whole is still a WIP, especially in regards to searching compressed data.
