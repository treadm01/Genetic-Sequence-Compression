level of detail - to computer scientists
discussion of compression, brief discussion of dna and the relation. Why it is needed.
possible methods why certain ones aren't chosen, 
why chosing the chosen method
discussion of other tools available - testing datasets etc - research etc 
- how it will be tested, current results, speed as well as compression designated file types, but emphasis on genetic?
objective - to implement further techniques suggested, hopefully improve, use different techniques if possible
- check ACT masters page for description
- what you plan to do, why certain decisions
- prototypes, weekly plans 
- compress multiple folder structures, access them via user interface - aim methodology one side the algorithm and benefits plus this side of it.
... write as review of previous papers
//- hashset hash map for storing rules, increase speed – steps to further decompress, keep generic?? … edit distance, across files? Multiple documents
